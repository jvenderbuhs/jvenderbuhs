### Hello, I'm Jordan!

I am a Ruby on Rails developer in the Point of Sale team at Jane Technologies, Inc.

I started programming as a hobby in Grade 10 making mods for MineCraft during it's Beta period. My first big win was when I released my first mod "Book of Healing" which allowed players to have a more compact way to carry around healing items and de-clutter their inventory. This mod went on to receive over a million users, and through a series of events eventually entered the official beta release of MineCraft (v1.9p2) in the Brewing system. Knowing that something I made was being enjoyed by so many was such a cool feeling and got me hooked on software development.
